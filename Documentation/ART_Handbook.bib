  abstract =   "Within computer graphics, the field of predictive rendering
               is concerned with those methods of image synthesis which
               yield results that do not only look real, but are also
               radiometrically correct renditions of nature, i.e.which are
               accurate predictions of what a real scene would look like
               under given lighting conditions.   In order to guarantee the
               correctness of the results obtained by such techniques,
               three stages of such a rendering system have to be verified
               with particular care: the light reflection models, the light
               transport simulation and the perceptually based calculations
               used at display time.  In this report, we will concentrate
               on the state of the art with respect to the second step in
               this chain. Various approaches for experimental verification
               of the implementation of a physically based rendering system
               have been proposed so far. However, the problem of proving
               that the results are correct is not fully solved yet, and no
               standardized methodology is available. We give an overview
               of existing literature, discuss the strengths and weaknesses
               of the described methods and illustrate the unsolved
               problems. We also briefly discuss the related issue of image
               quality metrics. ",

  abstract =   "CIE XYZ colour space is sometimes recommended in literature
               for photorealistic rendering computations because it allows
               one to simultaneously handle all perceivable colours at much
               lower computational cost than by using spectral rendering.  
               In this paper we show that XYZ is actually a poor choice for
               such computations, since it is not closed under the
               component-wise multiplication which is a typical operation
               in a rendering system. We also discuss why this rather
               obvious fact has not received much attention yet, and give
               pointers to alternative solutions.",

                 computes the spectral energy distribution of light
                 reflected from a surface. Geometric surface
                 characterestics such as surface roughness, microfacet
                 slope and microfacet orientation were modelled on a
                 statistical basis and used to predict both the spatial
                 and spectral distribution of the reflected light.
                 Surface reflection properties and light source
                 illumination functions were represented by real
                 spectral energy distribution on a wavelength basis,
                 rather than arbitary RGB colour triplets. Cook also
                 applied the Fresnel equation for reflection, resulting
                 in more accurate specular highlight intensities and
                 colour for metallic surfaces. This model is applicable
                 to a broad range of materials, surface conditions, and
                 lighting situations. - Vignasekaran 4/94",

                 patches is increased by dividing each existing patch

                 Integral Geometry and on the well-known algorithms for
                 Monte Carlo particle transport. It considers the scene
                 embedded in a field of lines, each representing the
                 exchange between the pairs of points that result from
                 the intersections of the line with the scene. For a
                 given pair of points, this exchange is bidirectional.
                 Lines are taken randomly. Both graphical and numerical
                 results are given for the proposed algorithm, which is

                 include all light transport only once in the final
                 solution. Therefore the different methods in current
                 multipass configurations handle a perfectly disjunct
                 part of the light transport. In this paper a Monte
                 Carlo variance reduction technique is presented that
                 probabilistically weights overlapping transport between
                 different methods. A good heuristic for the weights is
                 derived so that strengths of the respective methods are
                 retained. The technique is applied to a combination of
                 radiosity and bidirectional path tracing and
                 significant improvement is obtained over the
                 non-weighted combination. This method promises to be a
                 very useful extension to other multipass algorithms as

       plant architecture. This framework extends the
       formalism of Lindenmayer systems with constructs needed
       to model bi-directional information exchange between
       plants and their environment. We illustrate the
       proposed framework with models and simulations that
       capture the development of tree branches limited by
       collisions, the colonizing growth of clonal plants
       competing for space in favorable areas, the interaction
       between roots competing for water in the soil, and the
       competition within and between trees for access to
       light. Computer animation and visualization techniques
       make it possible to better understand the modeled
       processes and lead to realistic images of plants within
       their environmental context.}

                 pattern depends on wavelength, incidence angle, two
                 surface roughness parameters, and surface refractive
                 index. The formulation is self consistent in terms of
                 polarization, surface roughness, masking/shadowing, and
                 energy. The model applies to a wide range of materials
                 and surface finishes and provides a smooth transition
                 from diffuse-like to specular reflection as the
                 wavelength and incidence angle are increased or the
                 surface roughness is decreased. The model is analytic
                 and suitable for Computer Graphics applications.
                 Predicted reflectance distributions compare favorably
                 with experiment. The model is applied to metallic,
                 nonmetallic, and plastic materials, with smooth and
                 rough surfaces.",

                 Because any basis functions can be chosen, they can be
                 tailored to the scenes that are to be rendered. We

                 in the development of a number of improvements of
                 existing ray-tracing techniques. In summary, these
                 include a hybrid reflection model, a spectral-sampling
                 method, the incorporation of light sources, and
                 adaptive tree-depth control. Nevertheless, we point out
                 again that many of the problems of realistic image
                 generation through ray tracing have not been solved.
                 The inherent point-sampling technique is prone to
                 aliasing, the reflection models proposed do not include
                 the correct energy formulations, and the computational

                 spectral functions called the composite model. This
                 model is built on the idea that we decompose all
                 spectral functions into smooth and spiky components,
                 each with its own distinct representation.
                 Specifically, a smooth spectrum can be expressed as a
                 linear combination of a set of given basis functions
                 and thus be represented through the corresponding
                 coefficients. The discrete spikes in a spiky spectral
                 function can be represented directly through their
                 locations and heights. For the smooth spectra, we
                 propose re-sampling the functions that are
                 reconstructed from the coefficients in the linear
                 combination to improve efficiency. Spectral
                 multiplications are thus greatly reduced in complexity.
                 This new model demonstrates remarkable advantages in
                 representing spectral functions with aspect to
                 accuracy, compactness, computational efficiency,
                 portability, and flexibility. We expect that this work
                 will significantly contribute to the research and
                 applications in color science, realistic image
                 synthesis, and color image analysis.",

   abstract  = {Environment mapping is a technique to compute specular
       reflections for a glossy object. Originally proposed as
       a cheap alternative for ray tracing, the method is well
       suited to be incorporated in a hybrid rendering
       algorithm. In this paper environment mapping is
       introduced to reduce the amount of computations
       involved in tracing sec-ondary rays. During rendering,
       instead of tracing the secondary rays all through the
       scene, values are taken from the maps for the rays that
       would otherwise hit distant ob-jects. This way the
       quality of the image is retained while providing a
       cheap alternative to stochastic brute force sampling
       methods. An additional advantage is that due to the
       local representation of the entire 3D scene in a map,
       parallelising this algorithm should result in a good
       speed-up and high efficiency.},

       thousands of plants poses a number of problems. The
       terrain must be modeled and plants must be distributed
       throughout it in a realistic manner, reflecting the
       interactions of plants with each other and with their
       environment. Geometric models of individual plants,
       consistent with their positions within the ecosystem,
       must be synthesized to populate the scene. The scene,
       which may consist of billions of primitives, must be
       rendered efficiently while incorporating the subtleties
       of lighting in a natural environment. We have developed
       a system built around a pipeline of tools that address
       these tasks. The terrain is designed using an
       interactive graphical editor. Plant distribution is
       determined by hand (as one would do when designing a
       garden), by ecosystem simulation, or by a combination
       of both techniques. Given parametrized procedural
       models of individual plants, the geometric complexity
       of the scene is reduced by approximate instancing, in
       which similar plants, groups of plants, or plant organs
       are replaced by instances of representative objects
       before the scene is rendered. The paper includes
       examples of visually rich scenes synthesized using the
       system.},

       selecting proper rules, and are end-points of cyclic
       edges. Transformation nodes map the rays in affine
       space. Calculation nodes evaluate a finite set of
       arithmetic expressions to modify global parameters,
       which effect flow control and transformations. The

       method based on the concept of photon maps. It
       represents a significant improvement of a previously
       described approach both with respect to speed, accuracy
       and versatility. In the first pass two photon maps are
       created by emitting packets of energy (photons) from
       the light sources and storing these as they hit
       surfaces within the scene. We use one high resolution
       caustics photon map to render caustics that are
       visualized directly and one low resolution photon map
       that is used during the rendering step. The scene is
       rendered using a distribution ray tracing algorithm
       optimized by using the information in the photon maps.
       Shadow photons are used to render shadows more
       efficiently and the directional information in the
       photon map is used to generate more optimal sampling
       directions and to limit the recursion in the
       distribution ray tracer by providing an estimate of the
       radiance on all surfaces with the exception of specular
       and highly glossy surfaces. Noise and blur at
       discontinuities in the radiance estimate is reduced by
       using a cone filter. The results presented demonstrate
       global illumination in scenes containing procedural
       objects and surfaces with diffuse and glossy reflection
       models. The implementation is also compared with the
       Radiance program.},

   abstract  = {This paper presents an alternative radiosity
       formulation using piecewise smooth radiance functions
       that incorporates curved surfaces directly. Using the
       Galerkin integral equation technique as a mathematical
       foundation, surface radiance functions are approximated
       by polynomials. This model eliminates the need for a
       posteriori rendering interpolation, and allows the
       direct use of non-planar parametric surfaces.
       Convergence problems due to singularities in the
       radiosity kernel are analyzed and rectified, and
       sources of approximation error are examined. The
       incorporation of a shadow masking technique vastly
       reduces the need for meshing and associated storage
       space-accurate radiosity calculations can often be made
       with no meshing. The technique is demonstrated on
       traditional radiosity scenes, as well as environments
       with untessellated curved surfaces.}

       store the diffuse component (the radiosity) for
       later-reuse, similar to a radiosity algorithm.
       Radiosities are stored in {\em adaptive radiosity
       textures (rexes)} that record the pattern of light and
       shadow on every diffuse surface in the scene. They
       adaptively subdivide themselves to the appropriate
       level of detail for the picture being made, resolving
       sharp shadow edges automatically. \\ We use a
       three-pass, bidirectional ray tracing algorithm that
       traces rays from both the lights and the eye. The
       ``size pass'' records visibility information on diffuse
       surfaces; the ``light pass'' progressively traces rays
       from lights and bright surfaces to deposit photons on
       diffuse surfaces to construct the radiosity textures;
       and the ``eye pass'' traces rays from the eye,
       collecting light from diffuse surfaces to make a
       picture.},
